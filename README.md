## Abstract

«Monster Slayer» is a 2D game that we have chosen to design not only for children but also for adults
to play. Our main aim in making this assignment was to make an enjoyable game so that people are
both entertained and relaxed when playing it. The main objective of the game is to get to the end of
each level by killing the monsters and collecting coins. This makes it entertaining for people between
10 and above. The game will consist of 3 levels. Once they reach the end of a level, they will progress
to the next with harder to kill monsters. In the third and final level the player must defeat the final
boss before reaching the end of the game. To be able to complete the interfaces and implement the
application, many online tutorials were watched to ease the challenges faced. At the end of the
day, we have succeeded in implementing a game that meets all our aims and objectives stated in
the introduction section. In the future, we are planning to enhance the interface of the application
to make it more fun and interactive.
